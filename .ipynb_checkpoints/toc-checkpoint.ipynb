    "Nothing goes beyond the basics - the problems that you encounter when acquiring and processing texts for analysis and NLP. This aims to do that with a beginner reader in mind. Also aims to go beyond a simple set of code blocks and offer, in a quickly viewable format, the humanities reasoning behind using or not using particular approaches. After all, there are a number of ways to approach any problem, to tweak any processing. And any of them can have big ramifications for your results."
