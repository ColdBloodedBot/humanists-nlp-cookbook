The Acts of John, the Acts of Andrew  

and the Greek Novel

The study of the Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles (henceforth: AAA) has been do-
ing reasonably well in recent times. Swiss colleagues have been working for years 
on  critical  texts  of  the  major  Acts,  those  of  John,  Andrew,  Peter,  Paul,  and 
Thomas. Moreover, we now have a proper journal, Apocrypha, dedicated to the 
apocryphal literature. Yet it is clear that there is an enormous amount of work still 
to be done. Until now, we have only one critical authoritative text from the Swiss 
équipe, that of the Acts of John; the one of the Acts of Andrew by Jean-Marc Prieur 
(1947-2012) has not been able to establish itself as authoritative after the blister-
ing attack on its textual constitution by Lautaro Roig Lanzillotta (§ 2). Appearance 
of the editions of the other major texts does not seem to be in sight, however hard 
our Swiss colleagues have been working on them. But even with the texts as we 
have them, there is still much to be done: not only on the editions and contents as 
such, but also on their contextualisation within contemporary pagan and Christian 
culture. Moreover, these texts were not canonical texts whose content could be 
changed as little as possible, but they were transmitted in the following centuries 
by being supplemented, abbreviated, modified, and translated in all kinds of ways. 
In other words, as time went on, people will hardly have seen any difference be-
tween  them  and  other  hagiographical  writings  celebrating  the  lives  and,  espe-
cially, deaths of the Christian saints.1 It is obvious that these versions all need to 
be contextualised in their own period and culture. It is also obvious that a better 
understanding of this process transcends the ability of one person and is more the 
task of a whole équipe than of a single individual.  
  Given, then, the fact that the AAA constitute a living genre with a long life and 
the limits of my own knowledge, I will try to contribute to their contextualisation 
within contemporary culture by concentrating in this article on the influence of

the Greek novel on the earliest Acts, that is, Acts of John and the Acts of Andrew. 
It is not that I am the first to note the connection between the novel and the AAA 
in general.  In  1932, a young  German  scholar, Rosa  Söder  (1903-1991),  about 
whose life I have been unable to find any details, published a dissertation, in which 
she looked in quite some detail at the novel and the Acts, but in the end concluded 
that they did not influence one another.2 Later students of the novel have not dis-
played  the  same  interest.  Tomas  Hägg  (1938-2011)  and  Niklas  Holzberg  pay 
some attention to the AAA in their well known introductions to the ancient novel, 
but they are clearly happy to pass on to more congenial subjects.3 In the 1990s, 
the three collections by Jim Tatum, John Morgan, and Richard Stoneman, and 
Gareth  Schmeling  contained  between them  only  three,  not  always  satisfactory 
contributions on the AAA.4 It was only Kate Cooper, in The Virgin and the Bride, 
who once again discussed both the ancient novel and the AAA as manifestations 
of the same literary genre, but in recent years we have not seen a study that looks 
at this subject with a fresh eye.5  
  Yet we should be careful in speaking of the same genre, as the novel and the 
AAA have very different purposes with their writings. Even the AAA themselves 
are rather varied and clearly derive from a wide spectrum of early Christianity, 
although they share a similar kind of hagiographical discourse, the term intro-
duced by the Belgian early medievalist Marc Van Uytfanghe in order to look for 
the similarities in hagiographical content beyond the differences in genre.6 On the 
other hand, as I have argued elsewhere, the earlier AAA all belong to about the 
same period of time as the latest novels, except for Heliodorus, and derive from 
Asia Minor, the same area in which most of the surviving novels seem to have 
originated.7 Consequently, some of the similarities we see may well have been 
determined by the fact that the authors of the novel and the AAA lived in the same 
world. A good example of this shared world is the theatre, which in the novel and 
the AAA plays a prominent role, and which indeed in the first and second century 
gradually replaced the agora as the meeting place for the assembly.8  
  Another point is the similarity caused by the subject of the AAA and the ca-
nonical Acts of the Apostles. The latter focuses on Paul and his travels, which

makes  it  likely  that  the  other  apostles  also  travel,  the  more  so  as  they  all  are 
preaching the gospel of Christ. It is not that the authors of the AAA follow in any 
way the story line of the canonical Acts but it seems not implausible that the trav-
elling of the apostle Paul has exerted some influence on the later authors of the 
AAA, be it orally or via a written text, despite the fact that a direct influence of the 
canonical Acts on the apocryphal ones is very hard to establish.9 This may seem 
strange, certainly to those who have been raised with the authority of the Bible, 
but the rise of the canon was slow, and in the oldest AAA there is less influence of 
the books of the later Old and New Testament than one would have expected.10 
Consequently, the prominence of travelling in both groups of writings may be due 
to different causes, although a certain influence of the novel even on the canonical 
Acts can hardly be excluded. 
  A final point is the problem of the very texts that are our sources. As is well 
known, there is a textual uncertainty in the case of Chariton, and the text of Xen-
ophon has been much debated, but the textual tradition of the apocryphal AAA is 
much more complicated, as we do not have the full text of any of the older Acts, 
but in all cases have to do with texts that are constituted from various sources, 
sometimes, as in the case of the Acts of Peter and Acts of Paul, even from various 
languages, and always incomplete. It is therefore hard to present sustained anal-
yses of the main figures in the AAA in the same way as is possible with the sur-
viving Greek novels. Despite these problems, I will try to offer some thoughts 
showing that it is well worth to try to compare these writings. I will start with the 
Acts of John (§1), continue with the Acts of Andrew (§2) and end with a few con-
clusions (§ 3). 

The Acts of John 

Fortunately, the Acts of John is reasonably well preserved in parts, which enables 
us to make some observations, even though, given these preliminary considera-
tions, any comparison can only be partial and tentative. I have discussed its place 
and time of composition elsewhere and will not repeat my discussion here.11 Let 
it suffice to say that I locate the Acts in Asia Minor, plausibly Nicomedia, dating

to the 160s.12 The beginning of the work is lost, and our surviving text starts with 
John hastening from Miletus to Ephesus. Just before the apostle John enters Ephe-
sus, he is met by a certain Lycomedes, who beseeches the apostle to heal his wife, 
who has been lying paralysed for a week. The husband is desperate as he tells 
John that his situation is so catastrophic that he considered suicide (19, 20, also 
49),13 just as in Chariton Chaereas considers suicide when hearing of the unfaith-
fulness of Callirhoe (1.4.7, cf. 3.1.1) – in both cases in the beginning of the story.  
 
The name Lycomedes is most intriguing, as the father of Habrocomes in Xen-
ophon’s Ephesiaca is also called Lycomedes and, of course, also lives in Ephesus 
(1.1.1). The name itself is not without interest. Its most famous bearer was the 
king of the island of Scyros, at whose court Achilles, dressed up as a girl, was 
hidden by his mother Thetis in order to prevent him from joining the Trojan War. 
This was all in vain, as we know, as he was unmasked as a male youth by the 
clever Odysseus. This episode in his life was enormously popular in later antiquity 
and it figures on wall paintings, mosaics, and (above all) sarcophagi. As Alan 
Cameron (1938-2017) has observed: ‘the surprising popularity of this motif is no 
doubt its status as the turning point in Achilles’ life. As such, it lends itself (espe-
cially on sarcophagi) to symbolic interpretation: no man can escape his destiny’.14 
Undoubtedly, this popularity influenced the novel writer, who in turn influenced 
the author of the Acts of John, but it is very unlikely that the author had in mind a 
literal translation of the name, as has recently been argued in a study of the speak-
ing names in these Acts.15 
 
Surely, names were highly important in antiquity, but not all names at all 
times. Curiously, the author starts with names in Athenian and Roman comedy, 
but the importance of names in the novel is well attested and analysed, for exam-
ple, for the Ninos novel, Xenophon of Ephesus, Antonius Diogenes, Longus, and 
even Heliodorus.16 Yet not every name is significant, and there seems no reason 
to think that the name Lycomedes was chosen for any other reason than that it 
occurred in Xenophon’s novel.

THE ACTS OF JOHN, THE ACTS OF ANDREW AND THE GREEK NOVEL 

5 

  Our Christian Lycomedes is a stratêgos, that is, a member of the executive 
council  of  Ephesus.17  We  note  that  other  protagonists  in  the  Acts  of  John  are 
equally of high birth and, like some of the protagonists of the novel, are called ‘a 
first of (the Smyrnaeans, etc.)’, such as Antipater (56), just as Lycomedes in the 
Ephesiaca (1.1.1), and some others whom we will meet shortly. The expression, 
which also occurs in Chariton (2,5,4; 4,3,1; 4,4,3; 6,7,10) and Achilles Tatius 
(5,19,4; 6,12,2 and 16,5; 7,3,6), is typical of Northern Lycia and Southern Caria,18 
and from there spread eastwards, so that is it also found in the canonical Acts of 
the Apostles (13.50)’: in Pisidian Antioch, the Jews stirred up ‘the first of the city’ 
against Paul, although the nature of this vocabulary is not recognised in the Bible 
commentaries. Given that our AAA were probably composed in northern Asia Mi-
nor, this is also a derivation from the novel. The fact that in Chariton Callirhoe is 
the daughter of a stratêgos (1.3.6), although in this case a general, might not be 
fortuitous and must have given a contemporary ring to the reader.  
 
Lycomedes’ wife is called Cleopatra, which was not a common name in Ephe-
sus and may well have evoked the name of the Egyptian queens, the more so as 
the Ptolemies controlled Ephesus for a while,19 and the famous Cleopatra ban-
ished her sister Arsinoë to Ephesus before having her murdered. Cleopatra is de-
scribed by Lycomedes as follows: ‘Look, my lord, at this withered beauty, look 
at her youth, look at the famous flower(-like bloom) of my poor wife, for whom 
the whole of Ephesus was beyond itself’ (20). We have here not only the typical 
characteristics of a novel heroine, such as youth and beauty, but the comparison 
and metaphor of the flower irresistibly remind one of Anthia, the heroine of Xen-
ophon’s Ephesiaca, not only because of her name but also because the latter was 
equally the subject of more than normal admiration by the Ephesians (1,1,7). At 
the same time, though, we note that Callirhoë was also the object of admiration of 
‘the whole of Sicily’ (1,1,1). 
  However, just as Cleopatra is not introduced in a splendid manner like those 
novel heroines, so Lycomedes is not introduced like Habrocomes or Chaereas. 
We do not hear anything about his age or physical attractions, but we see him 
humbling himself by falling twice at the feet of the apostle (19, 20) when entreat-
ing him. Supplication is an old ritual in Greece, and self-humiliation is one of its 
prominent characteristics.20 However, even when John tells him to pull himself 
up, Lycomedes again falls on the floor, presumably to entreat the apostle once

again (21). Moreover, he is lamenting and crying in such a manner that the apostle 
has to firmly address him to control himself, but without success: it seems that 
Lycomedes has collapsed completely (21). 
 
But whereas Lycomedes clearly does not obey the apostle, it is different with 
Cleopatra. When John tells her to rise from her bed, she immediately cries out: ‘I 
arise, master, save your Cleopatra’. She gets up, after seven days, and the whole 
of Ephesus is moved by the astonishing sight (23). Whereas in the novels people 
admire young women because of their beauty, Cleopatra is admired because of 
her performance of a miracle of God. As a good wife, Cleopatra asks for her hus-
band, and when seeing Lycomedes lying dead in her bedroom – one wonders if 
the couple had separate bedrooms like modern royalty or the present American 
president – she loses her voice, closes her eyes and cries, but she still remains 
attentive to the apostle. Admiring her calm and self-control, the apostle calls upon 
Jesus to have mercy so that she will not follow Lycomedes and die. And indeed, 
he instructs Cleopatra as how to raise Lycomedes from the dead. She follows these 
instructions and euthus, ‘immediately’ raises him (24). The qualification ‘imme-
diately’ is typical of pagan and Christian miracle stories and helps to make the 
miracle even more impressive.21 Yet, subsequently, Lycomedes shows that he has 
not really understood the nature of the new faith by having a portrait made of the 
apostle and worshipping it (26-29). Unfortunately, the end of this episode has 
been lost and we then only hear of the couple caring for old women (30), a cate-
gory not exactly typical of the novel! 
 
There is now a kind of narratological interlude, as we hear no more of couples. 
For a while, the apostle turns his attention to the inhabitants of Ephesus and, in 
particular, their famous temple of Artemis. The moment that he addresses the 
Ephesians is dated very precisely: during the ‘birthday’ of the eidôleion, that is, 
‘the temple of the idol’ (38); the term is a Jewish neologism, which was later taken 
over by the Christians. Now we do not know of any celebration of the anniversary 
of Artemis’ temple, or any other temple for that matter, but we do know of the 
birthday of Artemis, and it seems fairly certain that we have to think of that festi-
val, which was celebrated in the spring on the sixth of the month Thargelion. We 
know through an inscription about an endowment of C. Vibius Salutaris that in 
AD 104 additional civic rituals and sacrifices were created, timed to coincide with 
the celebration of the mysteries of Artemis each year on the sixth of May, which 
clearly would have added to the festivities on the birthday of the goddess. Because 
of the endowment, a complex scheme of lotteries and cash distributions was doled 
out to individuals and civic institutions of the polis during the birthday, together

with an impressive procession.22 One may wonder if there is not a tie to Xeno-
phon’s beginning here, which also refers to a festival—although the latter is called 
‘the native festival of Artemis’ (1,2,2). In both cases, however, one cannot escape 
the impression that the author was not really at home in Ephesus, and neither of 
these designations recurs in the rich epigraphical evidence. 
 
Be this as it may, after the destruction of the temple, the conversion of the 
Ephesians and the raising of the priest of Artemis, the apostle sees in a dream that 
he had to walk outside the gates. He does so and meets a young man, who had 
been reprimanded by his father not to take the wife of his fellow labourer for 
himself. However, instead of obeying, the youth kicked his father. And as a result, 
the latter became unable to speak (48). Now the striking aspect of this scene is 
that only in the next chapters do we hear that the father has actually died (49-50). 
Fortunately, the apostle raises him, and the old man starts to believe. His son, 
however, takes his sickle, cut off his private parts and throws them in front of his 
former girlfriend. The apostle, for his part, does not condone this act and exhorts 
the youth to repent, which he duly does. Now exactly this same sequence of kick 
in  the  stomach  with  the  result  of  speechlessness,  is  found  in  Chariton,  where 
Chaereas kicks Callirhoe in the stomach, who then loses her ability to speak; in 
fact, the kick is referred to several times so that it need not be surprising that the 
author of the AJ uses the event in his own novel.23 
 
The precise order of the chapters of the Acts of John is not quite clear and for 
our purpose we proceed now, after a long passage which might well be an addition 
made at a later stage,24 to another couple, who are also protagonists in thse Acts. 
Having been in Smyrna, the apostle returns, via Laodicea (58-59), to Ephesus, 
where we rejoin him and his company. Part of this company is the couple An-
dronicus and Drusiana. Andronicus has already been mentioned in connection 
with the caring for the old women (31). At that moment, though, he clearly was 
not a follower of Christ, but, like Lycomedes, he belongs to the elite of the city: 
he is both a stratêgos and a member of the ‘firsts’, the local aristocracy (31). Later, 
however, he clearly has converted and is following John together with his wife 
Drusiana (58). 
  Unfortunately, the chapter in which Drusiana is introduced in the story has 
been lost, so that we meet her without knowing how the author has characterised 
her. All we get to know about her, apart from her religious activities, is that she 
was born in Ephesus (64), which suggests that she also was of the same social 
class as her husband. Apparently, she had converted first as, from allusions in the

Acts of John and the Manichaean Coptic Psalter, it appears that after her conver-
sion Andronicus had locked up Drusiana and John together in a tomb.25 After two 
weeks they were released, the husband also converted, and the couple started to 
live together as brother and sister (63).26 It is obvious that we are far from the 
novel in this situation. Yet the novel may still help us to note some other motifs 
than we have seen so far.  
  However, we first return to familiar territory. A young man had fallen in love 
with Drusiana the moment he saw her (63). Such a coup de foudre we also find in 
Chariton (1.1.6), where Chaereas and Callirhoe fall in love when they see one 
another, just as in Xenophon (1,3,1-2) where Anthia and Habrocomes see one 
another in the sanctuary where they were going to sacrifice. In our case, though, 
the gaze is asymmetrical: we do not hear of Drusiana seeing her suitor. On the 
contrary, as we will see momentarily. Interestingly, we are not told the name of 
the young man in love with her until nearly the end of the episode that interests 
us. There we hear that he is called Callimachus, a rare name in Ionia,27 which is 
presumably chosen to appeal to well educated readers. Does it mean that our au-
thor had also read Callimachus? Pieter Lalleman has ingeniously compared the 
notice in c. 113 that despite the fact that Christ wants the young John to preserve 
his virginity, the future apostle three times plans a marriage. However, all three 
times John is frustrated by illness.28 Now exactly the same sequence is found in 
Callimachus’ version of the myth of Acontius and Cydippe (Call. fr. 75.14-19 
Harder), with the difference that in that case it is Cydippe who falls ill three times. 
Now Koen De Temmerman has suggested the possibility, if not plausibility, that 
the author of Chariton precisely used this myth from Callimachus.29 Had the au-
thor of the Acts of John noted this too? On the other hand, Longus also seems to 
have alluded to this myth,30 which was perhaps more popular than we can see 
nowadays. 
  Our Callimachus is also one of the first of the city, and he is young (73). The 
latter quality suggests that Drusiana is also young, as toyboys of older women are 
not really the stuff of the novel. The young man tried to win Drusiana, but she

25  Junod and Kaestli 1983, 2.549, rightly point to the novel for this motif; add Letoublon, 1993, 
74-78. Note the frequent mention of the name Drusiana in Manichaean texts as a testimony 
to the success of the Acts of John in those circles: Gardner 1999, no. 19.62, 73; 21.20; 28.31.

refused his avances. Afraid to be insulted, I guess, by his friends because of his 
failure to win Drusiana, Callimachus falls into a state of melancholy, which we 
may perhaps diagnose as love-sickness – a well-known feature in antiquity and 
most famously attested for the stepson of the Seleucid queen Stratonice.31 Sur-
prisingly, it is now Drusiana who becomes despondent because of Callimachus’ 
despair and she even dies, rather dramatically, in the presence of the apostle, who 
apparently was ignorant of the true state of affairs (64). 
  After her burial, John hears the real background to her death from her hus-
band, but instead of acting in connection with Drusiana he delivers a long oration 
to exhort the brethren to despise transitory things. The young man, however, who 
still is not mentioned by name, does not give up his lust. He bribes the steward, 
oikonomos/vilicus, of Andronicus for a large sum of money to open the tomb of 
Drusiana for him (70). This bribing of an employee is clearly also taken from the 
novel. In Chariton (1,4,2), it is the suitor from Acragas who has a friend persuade 
the trusted servant of Callirhoe with presents and a suicide threat to let him into 
the house, and in Xenophon (3,2,7-8) it is the rich Aristomachos who bribes the 
father of Hippothoos to let him near his son; in fact, the latter case is rather re-
markable as the father must belong to the elite of the town, given that his son was 
training in the gymnasium (3,2,2).  
 
They start to undress Drusiana and when they are at the point of removing the 
last garment, the rather expensive dikrossion,32 at this decisive moment, a snake 
appears who kills the steward with a bite and nestles on the young man, who had 
fallen on the ground, and keeps him there.33 It seems obvious that Callimachus 
intended to perform a necrophiliac act, not something one immediately expects in 
an early Christian text and, surely, significant regarding its intended audience, 
which presumably liked this risqué theme. We should realise, though, that the 
theme was not unusual in ancient literature. Achilles fell in love with the corpse 
of Penthesileia and the tyrant Periander with his dead wife Melissa. Closer to our 
time, we have two authors coming from Asia Minor: necrophilia appears in one 
of the vignettes of the Erotika pathemata of Parthenius (31), an author living at 
the end of the first century BC, and in Phlegon of Tralles’ Mirabilia (1), an author 
living at the time of Hadrian.34  
 
It is thus, perhaps, not surprising that we find hints of necrophilia also in the 
novel. In Chariton (3,7,6), we hear that Callirhoe loves Chaereas even though he

is dead, but Xenophon (5,1,9-11) goes further and hints at this love twice. First, 
when an old woman tells Habrocomes that his Anthia has died but that her tomb 
has been looted and her corpse disappeared,35 he laments: ‘which robber is so 
amorous that he lusts for you even as you are a corpse?’ (3,10,2) When searching 
for Anthia, he is received by an old man, Aigialeus, who has embalmed his wife 
Thelxinoe and lives with her as if she is alive. The sexual act is not mentioned, 
but he certainly sleeps with her and kisses her (5,1,9-11). The author of the AJ is 
more outrageous and clearly suggests a proper necrophiliac act, even though at 
the very last moment this has been prevented by the snake. In fact, her husband 
explicitly tells John when they have arrived at the grave that Callimachus avowed 
to many people; ‘Even if she would not give in to me when alive, now she is dead 
she will be violated’ (74).  
 
Interestingly, John first raises Callimachus from the ground, who duly con-
verts. But Andronicus and the other brethren then entreat John to raise Drusiana 
from the dead, which he of course does. She, hardly surprisingly, shows herself a 
bit perplexed by being in her undergarment – one has the feeling of some very 
soft porno here – and dresses herself again. She then asks John to resurrect the 
dead steward. Callimachus speaks against it, but the apostle berates him for want-
ing to return evil for evil and charges Drusiana to do it. She performs the resur-
rection without any hesitation, but the raised steward does not convert and flees 
the tomb. Apparently, salvation is for the upper class, not for the workers, in the 
eyes of the author. With this episode we approach the end of the Acts of John, 
which concentrates on his last act of worship and passing away, aspects that are 
not relevant for our theme. So let us now turn to the Acts of Andrew. 

The Acts of Andrew 

The textual situation of the Acts of Andrew is pretty distressing, but Janet Spittler 
has given a good summary of the present situation.36 She persuasively argues that 
we should take a kind of middle road between the all too generous textual consti-
tution of Prieur and the all too strict version of Roig Lanzillotta.37 Be that as it 
may, it is clear that we have very little left from the original Acts of Andrew, and 
mostly speeches and the material regarding the apostle’s martyrdom – the latter

being the element of the apostles’ lives in which the later Christians were inter-
ested most and which, perhaps, also had the least chance of being ‘infected’ with 
heretical ideas. Gregory of Tours had, apparently, still access to the original ver-
sion, but he abbreviated and ‘updated’ the text so that we can use his version only 
with the utmost care. Yet the fact that he gives us a number of names of minor 
characters which are modelled on famous Greek authors, such as the lyric poet 
Alcman (4, AAlat 34: Alcmanes), the highly popular comedy authors Cratinus 
(AAlat 5) and Antiphanes (15; AAlat 29), and the proconsul Lesbios, whose name 
in this literary company evokes the island of Lesbos, which was famous for its 
poets Alcaeus and Sappho (AAlat 22), suggests that Gregory certainly stuck to the 
original to some extent. At the same time, these names suggest that the author of 
the Acts of Andrew was somebody with a literary interest who also presupposed 
that interest among his readers. Given the close verbal parallels between the Acts 
of John and the Acts of Andrew,38 it seems reasonable to suppose that they were 
written in contemporary proximity, perhaps even in the same city of Nicomedia.39  
  As far as I can see, there are only a few parallels between the Acts of Andrew 
and the novel and mostly at a more general level. Let me start with two fairly close 
parallels. When Andrew is in prison, he is visited by Maximilla and her trusted 
servant Iphidama. ‘And having put his hands on her eyes and taken them to her 
mouth, she (Maximilla) began to relate…’ (37 Prieur = 5 Roig Lanzillotta). We 
find nearly the same gesture in the same situation in Achilles Tatius (5,27), where 
Melite visits Clitophon in prison, kisses his hands and brings them to her eyes and 
heart. A second example is the outburst of Andrew when talking to Maximilla 
about her husband’s threats: ‘As for me, let him inflict on me not only the tortures 
of prison, but let him throw me to the beasts, burn me with fire or throw me off a 
cliff’ (39 Prieur = 7, tr. Roig Lanzillotta), which we may compare with the, albeit 
more dramatic, outburst of Leucippe to Thersandros: ‘Set out your tortures, bring 
up the wheel. Here are my arms, stretch them out. Bring your scourges too: here 
is my back, smite upon it. Bring your fire: here is my body, burn it, etc.’ (Ach. 
Tat. 6,21). 
  An  example  of  ‘real  life’  is  perhaps  the  case  of  Maximilla  and  her  slave 
Euklia. Maximilla is the wife of the Roman governor Aegeates, who has been 
converted by the apostle Andrew and, consequently, no longer wants to sleep with 
her husband. However, she does not confront her husband directly regarding this

‘verbal parallels’ (143) the, probably, Christian neologism θρήσκευμα, ‘religious practice’, 
in Acts of John 39-40 and Acts of Andrew 7, which does not re-appear before Synesius, 
Aegyptii sive de providentia 1.18.

matter but she bribes her young, beautiful slave Euklia to sleep with her husband 
instead of her – a ruse that was possible as the Roman upper-class customarily 
made love in the dark.40 Such a bribing of a subordinate was not unusual in the 
novel, where we hear of such practices in Chariton, who mentions the bribing of 
a female slave (1,4,1-2), and Xenophon (3,2,7-8), but also in the Acts of John 
where  the  youth  enamoured  of  Drusiana  bribes  a  subordinate  of  her  husband 
(70,4-5) and the Acts of Paul (18), in which Thecla bribes the door keeper and the 
goaler to give her access to Paul.  
 
Through Euklia, then, Maximilla could go to the meetings with Andrew, but 
when the latter hears in a dream that there will be trouble in the house of Aegeates, 
she ‘changed her dress, as was usual, in the sight of everybody’ (19). The latter 
detail is intriguing and suggests some frisson, as normally other males, surely, 
would never see a Roman matrona change her clothes. Perhaps it suggests her 
rejection of female sexuality? A similar change of clothes we find a bit later when 
Maximilla asks her trusted servant Iphidama to find the prison in which Andrew 
has been locked up (27). The latter changes from her usual dress, ‘loyal as she 
was’ (28). In any case, change of clothes is a not unfamiliar motif in the novel. 
We find it in Achilles Tatius (6.1), where Clitophon puts on the clothes of Melite 
in order not to be recognised, and in the Acts of Paul and Thecla, where Thecla 
puts on a male dress.41 Obviously, the function of these changes is not identical 
in all these cases, but they show how the pagan and Christian novelists could use 
objects and things in their writings. 
 
Let us now turn to two passages which have parallels in the novel, but which 
might also have been derived from ‘real life’. In Gregory’s On the Miracles of the 
Holy Apostle Andrew (23), we are told that a former concubine of the proconsul, 
Trophime,  who  had  subsequently  lived  with  another  man,  had  abandoned  her 
lover in order to follow Andrew. He complained about her desertion to the wife 
of the proconsul, who condemned her to prostitution, and she was immediately 
put into a brothel. Similarly, in Xenophon’s novel (5,7), Anthia is sold to a brothel 
keeper who puts her, well dressed, in front of the door. The penalty was not wholly 
unusual in antiquity,42 but in the novelistic and later hagiographical versions the 
girl of course manages to save her virginity.43 In the novel, Anthia pretends to be 
struck by epilepsy, but in Gregory the woman shields herself from unwanted cus-
tomers by wearing a miniature gospel on her bosom. Such miniature codices are

well known for apotropaic purposes, but they only occur from the fourth century 
onwards:44 evidently, at this point Gregory has ‘updated’ his source. 
  Our final example brings us back to southern Anatolia.45 In Macedonian Phi-
lippi, Andrew prevented a wedding between two pairs of cousins (AAlat 11), the 
children of two brothers. The moment itself is narrated with a feeling for drama, 
since the marriage is nearly consummated and the parents are already wearing the 
wedding garlands, as befitted such a festive event. At that very moment, the apos-
tle arrived and spoilt the party. Now incest between cousins was not an issue in 
those days. In fact, the prohibition of a marriage between cousins appears first in 
the Councils of Epaon (AD 517: canon 30) and Toledo (AD 531: canon 5), that 
is, right at the time of Gregory. Consequently, in the original AA the episode will 
have been directed against marriage rather than against incest.  
 
For us, though, it is interesting to observe that we find a similar union in 
Achilles Tatius’ Leucippe and Clitophon, since the homonymous protagonists of 
the novel are children of two brothers (1,3,6-4.1). This is hardly chance. As I ar-
gued before, Achilles Tatius probably came from southern Anatolia,46 and pre-
cisely such marriages are particularly found in the cities of Lycia and neighbour-
ing regions, whereas the evidence for close-kin marriage in western, northern and 
central Anatolia (Ionia, Lydia, Bithynia, Phrygia) is very scanty by comparison.47 
Another interesting example can be found in Apuleius (Met. 4,26), whose Greek 
model, the Metamorphoseis ascribed to ‘Lucius of Patrai’, probably was also com-
posed in Southern Anatolia.48 Here a girl relates that, on the very day of her wed-
ding, bandits had taken away her consobrinus, ‘cousin’, whom omnis civitas had 
elected as filium publicum, that is, a ‘son of the city’, a honorary title especially 
popular, once again, in Southern Anatolia in the second century.49 

Conclusions 

With these examples we have come to the end of our survey. What can we con-
clude?  First,  we  note  that  the  Acts  of  John  has  used  motifs  and  scenes  from

Chariton and Xenophon’s Ephesiaca, but not from Achilles Tatius’ novel.50 On 
the other hand, the Acts of Andrew, which knows the Acts of John and thus is later, 
perhaps dating to the 170s, does use Achilles Tatius. Did the novel of Achilles 
Tatius only reach Northern Asia Minor well after its publication? 
 
Secondly, when we look at the comparisons, we note that the references to 
the novel seem to be more prominent in the beginnings of the episodes discussed 
by us than in the other parts of these AAA. Perhaps it was enough for the authors 
of these AAA to signal to his readers that they were well acquainted with the cur-
rent popular literature? In any case, the usage of the novel as well as the reference 
to Callimachus in the case of the Acts of John and the references to classical au-
thors in the Acts of Andrew suggest cultured authors who, presumably, wrote for 
cultured readers.  
 
Thirdly,  there  are  obvious  differences  between  the  novel  and  the  AAA. 
Whereas the novel ends in the reunion of the couple, who will enter now a happily 
married life with plenty of sex, one presumes, the couples in the AAA ideally end 
up in a chaste Platonic relationship. So why did the authors of these narratives 
look to the novel? The answer may lie in the intended readership. It is striking 
how in the oldest two AAA, those of John and Andrew, it is the women who are 
steadfast and decisive, especially of course, but not only, in the new faith, whereas 
the males are wavering and sometimes not very masculine in their behaviour. Now 
we know that the males of the senatorial class did not convert before Constantine, 
and our evidence for the layers immediately below that class is rather meagre.51 I 
have argued before that in Asia Minor plenty of women of the higher classes were 
able to read and write as could many other women in the Roman Empire.52 In fact, 
the evidence of reading and writing women is still increasing, although the early 
Christian evidence remains neglected in the most recent studies of female liter-
acy.53 Given the resistance to conversion of upper-class males, it is hardly strange 
that the authors of the AAA directed therefore their attention to the women, as may 
already have been done by the authors of the novel.54 Admittedly, Kim Haines-
Eitzen has argued that the rather later papyri and parchments of the AAA do not 
point to women readers.55 Now apart from the fact that the very slim evidence we

have in this respect—only about 13 examples56—can hardly be representative, it 
is also clear that we do not know who owned or read these papyri. Moreover, from 
the much later, mostly fourth-century usage in Egypt it is hardly admissible to 
extrapolate a usage in later second-century Asia Minor. 
 
Finally, against my own and others’ suggestions, the socio-linguistic and nar-
ratological study of the Acts of John by Julia Snyder has persuasively argued that 
this text was intended for an established Christian audience, and was not produced 
for missionary purposes,57 and the same will have been the case with the Acts of 
Andrew. Yet that result does not exclude the fact that the author of the Acts of 
John had several intentions. It seems clear that his stress on a moderate asceticism 
– castration clearly went too far and we nowhere here of a divorce being favoured 
– was one of the important incentives for the author to compose his Christian 
romance. As such, he may have inspired the author of the Acts of Andrew, even 
though the latter seems to have had a more philosophical than ethical interest.58 
And given the prominent place of ‘strong’ women in his Christian alternative to 
the novel, it seems plausible that the intended readership were indeed higher-class 
women, perhaps those who served as pillars and patronesses of local churches. 
That our authors used the ancient novel with its glorification of physical love for 
this ascetic purpose remains one of the intriguing aspects of these Apocryphal 
Acts.59
