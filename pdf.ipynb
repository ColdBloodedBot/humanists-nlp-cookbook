    "When working with digitally available humanities data you might start feeling that your data is everywhere, but not in the right format you need to run computational analysis on it. While the amount of digitally available data continues to grow, it is often only available in a Portable Document Format (PDF). While it might appear that posessing PDF versions of all your texts could give you access to your materials, extra work is necessary to convert these materials into formats you can use for digital text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not to fear. There are many Python tools that can allow you to extract a PDF's image and/or textual data into a format that is condusive for distant reading. In general, when working with a PDF there is one central question to consider:\n",

Of the two, PDFminer is the easier to set up, especially you use a Windows machine. Poppler is the more powerful program, and may be better suited to your needs if you are working with images.\n",

      "Reading this book, I had the vision of a land, heretofore sunk in \n",
      "the mists of muteness, suddenly rising up into the eminence of song. \n",
      "Innumerable books have been written about the South; some good books \n",
      "have been written in the South. This book _is_ the South. I do not \n",
      "mean that _Cane_ covers the South or is the South’s full voice. Merely \n",
      "this: a poet has arisen among our American youth who has known how to \n",
      "turn the essences and materials of his Southland into the essences and \n",
      "materials of literature. A poet has arisen in that land who writes, not \n",
      "as a Southerner, not as a rebel against Southerners, not as a Negro, \n",
      "not as apologist or priest or critic: who writes as a _poet_. The \n",
      "fashioning of beauty is ever foremost in his inspiration: not forcedly \n",
      "but simply, and because these ultimate aspects of his world are to him \n",
      "more real than all its specific problems. He has made songs and lovely \n",
      "stories of his land ... not of its yesterday, but of its immediate \n",
      "life. And that has been enough. \n",
      " \n",
      "How rare this is will be clear to those who have followed with \n",
      "concern the struggle of the South toward literary expression, and the \n",
      "particular trial of that portion of its folk whose skin is dark. The \n",
      "gifted Negro has been too often thwarted from becoming a poet because \n",
      "his world was forever forcing him to recollect that he was a Negro. \n",
      "The artist must lose such lesser identities in the great well of life. \n",
      "The English poet is not forever protesting and recalling that he is \n",
      "English. It is so natural and easy for him to be English that he can \n",
      "sing as a man. The French novelist is not forever noting: “This is \n",
      "French.” It is so atmospheric for him to be French, that he can devote \n",
      "himself to saying: “This is human.” This is an imperative condition for \n",
      "the creating of deep art. The whole will and mind of the creator must \n",
      "go below the surfaces of race. And this has been an almost impossible \n",
      "condition for the American Negro to achieve, forced every moment of his \n",
      "life into a specific and superficial plane of consciousness. \n",
      " \n",
      "The first negative significance of _Cane_ is that this so natural \n",
      "and restrictive state of mind is completely lacking. For Toomer, \n",
      "the Southland is not a problem to be solved; it is a field of \n",
      "loveliness to be sung: the Georgia Negro is not a downtrodden soul \n",
      "to be uplifted; he is material for gorgeous painting: the segregated \n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "self-conscious brown belt of Washington is not a topic to be discussed \n",
      "and exposed; it is a subject of beauty and of drama, worthy of creation \n",
      "in literary form. \n",
      " \n",
      "It seems to me, therefore, that this is a first book in more ways \n",
      "than one. It is a harbinger of the South’s literary maturity: of its \n",
      "emergence from the obsession put upon its minds by the unending racial \n",
      "crisis—an obsession from which writers have made their indirect escape \n",
      "through sentimentalism, exoticism, polemic, “problem” fiction, and \n",
      "moral melodrama. It marks the dawn of direct and unafraid creation. \n",
      "And, as the initial work of a man of twenty-seven, it is the harbinger \n",
      "of a literary force of whose incalculable future I believe no reader of \n",
      "this book will be in doubt. \n",
      " \n",
      "How typical is _Cane_ of the South’s still virgin soil and of its \n",
      "pressing seeds! and the book’s chaos of verse, tale, drama, its \n",
      "rhythmic rolling shift from lyrism to narrative, from mystery to \n",
      "intimate pathos! But read the book through and you will see a \n",
      "complex and significant form take substance from its chaos. Part One \n",
      "is the primitive and evanescent black world of Georgia. Part Two is \n",
      "the threshing and suffering brown world of Washington, lifted by \n",
      "opportunity and contact into the anguish of self-conscious struggle. \n",
      "Part Three is Georgia again ... the invasion into this black womb of \n",
      "the ferment seed: the neurotic, educated, spiritually stirring Negro. \n",
      "As a broad form this is superb, and the very looseness and unexpected \n",
      "waves of the book’s parts make _Cane_ still more _South_, still more of \n",
      "an æsthetic equivalent of the land. \n",
      " \n",
      "What a land it is! What an Æschylean beauty to its fateful problem! \n",
      "Those of you who love our South will find here some of your love. Those \n",
      "of you who know it not will perhaps begin to understand what a warm \n",
      "splendor is at last at dawn. \n",
      " \n",
      "    A feast of moon and men and barking hounds, \n",
      "    An orgy for some genius of the South \n",

      "    Surprised in making folk-songs.... \n",
      " \n",
      "So, in his still sometimes clumsy stride (for Toomer is finally a \n",
      "poet in prose) the author gives you an inkling of his revelation. An \n",
      "individual force, wise enough to drink humbly at this great spring of \n",
      "his land ... such is the first impression of Jean Toomer. But beyond \n",
      "this wisdom and this power (which shows itself perhaps most splendidly \n",
      "in his complete freedom from the sense of persecution), there rises \n",
      "a figure more significant: the artist, hard, self-immolating, the \n",
      "artist who is not interested in races, whose domain is Life. The book’s \n",
      "final Part is no longer “promise”; it is achievement. It is no mere \n",
      "dawn: it is a bit of the full morning. These materials ... the ancient \n",
      "black man, mute, inaccessible, and yet so mystically close to the new \n",
      "tumultuous members of his race, the simple slave Past, the shredding \n",

      "Ned wore his long pants. Us fellers were seated on the curb before an \n",
      "apartment house where she had gone in. The young trees had not outgrown \n",
      "their boxes then. V Street was lined with them. When our legs grew \n",
      "cramped and stiff from the cold of the stone, we’d stand around a box \n",

      "gave us a chance to complete the plans of how we were going to stone \n",
      "and beat that feller on the top floor out of town. Ned especially had \n",
      "it in for him. He was about to throw a brick up at the window when at \n",
      "last the room went dark. Some minutes passed. Then Avey, as unconcerned \n",
      "as if she had been paying an old-maid aunt a visit, came out. I don’t \n",
      "remember what she had on, and all that sort of thing. But I do know \n",
      "that I turned hot as bare pavements in the summertime at Ned’s boast: \n",
      "“Hell, bet I could get her too if you little niggers weren’t always \n",
      "spying and crabbing everything.” I didnt say a word to him. It wasnt \n",
      "my way then. I just stood there like the others, and something like \n",
      "a fuse burned up inside of me. She never noticed us, but swung along \n",
      "lazy and easy as anything. We sauntered to the corner and watched her \n",
      "till her door banged to. Ned repeated what he’d said. I didnt seem \n",
      "to care. Sitting around old Mush-Head’s bread box, the discussion \n",
      "began. “Hang if I can see how she gets away with it,” Doc started. \n",
      "Ned knew, of course. There was nothing he didnt know when it came to \n",
      "women. He dilated on the emotional needs of girls. Said they werent \n",
      "much different from men in that respect. And concluded with the solemn \n",
      "avowal: “It does em good.” None of us liked Ned much. We all talked \n",
      "dirt; but it was the way he said it. And then too, a couple of the \n",
      "fellers had sisters and had caught Ned playing with them. But there was \n",
      "no disputing the superiority of his smutty wisdom. Bubs Sanborn, whose \n",

      "“Avey’s mother’s ont her,” he said. We thought that only natural and \n",
      "began to guess at what would happen. Some one said she’d marry that \n",
      "feller on the top floor. Ned called that a lie because Avey was going \n",
      "to marry nobody but him. We had our doubts about that, but we did agree \n",
      "that she’d soon leave school and marry some one. The gang broke up, and \n",

      "basket-ball, and when I’d make a long clean shot she’d clap with the \n",
      "others, louder than they, I thought. I’d meet her on the street, and \n",
      "there’d be no difference in the way she said hello. She never took the \n",
      "trouble to call me by my name. On the days for drill, I’d let my voice \n",
      "down a tone and call for a complicated maneuver when I saw her coming. \n",
      "She’d smile appreciation, but it was an impersonal smile, never for me. \n",
      "It was on a summer excursion down to Riverview that she first seemed to \n",
      "take me into account. The day had been spent riding merry-go-rounds, \n",
      "scenic-railways, and shoot-the-chutes. We had been in swimming and we \n",

      "in my arms, she was way away. That college feller who lived on the top \n",
      "floor was somewhere making money for the next year. I imagined that \n",

      "was sweet like clover. And every now and then, a salt tang, a stale \n",
      "drift of sea-weed. It was not my mind’s fault if it went romancing. I \n",
      "should have taken her in my arms the minute we were stowed in that old \n",

      "I felt chagrined. I didnt know what it was, but I did know that I \n",
      "couldnt handle it. She ran her fingers through my hair and kissed \n",
      "my forehead. I itched to break through her tenderness to passion. \n",
      "I wanted her to take me in her arms as I knew she had that college \n",
      "feller. I wanted her to love me passionately as she did him. I gave her \n",
      "one burning kiss. Then she laid me in her lap as if I were a child. \n",
      "Helpless. I got sore when she started to hum a lullaby. She wouldnt \n",
      "let me go. I talked. I knew damned well that I could beat her at that. \n",
      "Her eyes were soft and misty, the curves of her lips were wistful, and \n",
      "her smile seemed indulgent of the irrelevance of my remarks. I gave up \n",
      "at last and let her love me, silently, in her own way. The moon was \n",
      "brilliant. The air was sweet like clover, and every now and then, a \n",

      "When I was through, she’d seek my hand and hold it till my pulse cooled \n",
      "down. Evening after evening we sat there. I tried to get her to talk \n",
      "about that college feller. She never would. There was no set time to go \n",
      "home. None of my family had come down. And as for hers, she didnt give \n",

      "Avey, indolent as ever, leaning on the arm of a man, strolling under \n",

      "some fine, costly stuff. I suggested the park, and then added that the \n",

      " \n",
      "Halsey’s workshop. It is an old building just off the main street \n",
      "of Sempter. The walls to within a few feet of the ground are of an \n",
      "age-worn cement mixture. On the outside they are considerably crumbled \n",
      "and peppered with what looks like musket-shot. Inside, the plaster has \n",
      "fallen away in great chunks, leaving the laths, grayed and cobwebbed, \n",
      "exposed. A sort of loft above the shop proper serves as a break-water \n",
      "for the rain and sunshine which otherwise would have free entry to the \n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "main floor. The shop is filled with old wheels and parts of wheels, \n",
      "broken shafts, and wooden litter. A double door, midway the street \n",
      "wall. To the left of this, a work-bench that holds a vise and a variety \n",
      "of wood-work tools. A window with as many panes broken as whole, throws \n",
      "light on the bench. Opposite, in the rear wall, a second window looks \n",
      "out upon the back yard. In the left wall, a rickety smoke-blackened \n",
      "chimney, and hearth with fire blazing. Smooth-worn chairs grouped about \n",
      "the hearth suggest the village meeting-place. Several large wooden \n",
      "blocks, chipped and cut and sawed on their upper surfaces are in the \n",
      "middle of the floor. They are the supports used in almost any sort of \n",
      "wagon-work. Their idleness means that Halsey has no worth-while job on \n",
      "foot. To the right of the central door is a junk heap, and directly \n",
      "behind this, stairs that lead down into the cellar. The cellar is known \n",
      "as “The Hole.” Besides being the home of a very old man, it is used by \n",

      "his position. Braces an arm against the door. Kabnis passes the window \n",
      "and stoops to get in under Halsey’s arm. He is awkward and ludicrous, \n",
      "like a schoolboy in his big brother’s new overalls. He skirts the large \n",

      "to the fire till the heat stings his shins. Pushes back. Pokes the \n",

      "One asks Halsey for a cigarette. He gets it. The blacksmith, a \n",

      "carrying. There is a slight stoop to her shoulders. The curves of her \n",

      "variant. Black bangs curl over the forehead of her oval-olive face. \n",
      "Her expression is dazed, but on provocation it can melt into a wistful \n",

      "her unwitting attention. Their meeting is a swift sun-burst. Lewis \n",
      "impulsively moves towards her. His mind flashes images of her life \n",
      "in the southern town. He sees the nascent woman, her flesh already \n",
      "stiffening to cartilage, drying to bone. Her spirit-bloom, even now \n",
      "touched sullen, bitter. Her rich beauty fading... He wants to— He \n",
      "stretches forth his hands to hers. He takes them. They feel like warm \n",

      "haloes him. Christ-eyes, his eyes look to her. Fearlessly she loves \n",
      "into them. And then something happens. Her face blanches. Awkwardly \n",

      "Reading this book, I had the vision of a land, heretofore sunk in \n",
      "the mists of muteness, suddenly rising up into the eminence of song. \n",
      "Innumerable books have been written about the South; some good books \n",
      "have been written in the South. This book _is_ the South. I do not \n",
      "mean that _Cane_ covers the South or is the South’s full voice. Merely \n",
      "this: a poet has arisen among our American youth who has known how to \n",
      "turn the essences and materials of his Southland into the essences and \n",
      "materials of literature. A poet has arisen in that land who writes, not \n",
      "as a Southerner, not as a rebel against Southerners, not as a Negro, \n",
      "not as apologist or priest or critic: who writes as a _poet_. The \n",
      "fashioning of beauty is ever foremost in his inspiration: not forcedly \n",
      "but simply, and because these ultimate aspects of his world are to him \n",
      "more real than all its specific problems. He has made songs and lovely \n",
      "stories of his land ... not of its yesterday, but of its immediate \n",
      "life. And that has been enough. \n",
      " \n",
      "How rare this is will be clear to those who have followed with \n",
      "concern the struggle of the South toward literary expression, and the \n",
      "particular trial of that portion of its folk whose skin is dark. The \n",
      "gifted Negro has been too often thwarted from becoming a poet because \n",
      "his world was forever forcing him to recollect that he was a Negro. \n",
      "The artist must lose such lesser identities in the great well of life. \n",
      "The English poet is not forever protesting and recalling that he is \n",
      "English. It is so natural and easy for him to be English that he can \n",
      "sing as a man. The French novelist is not forever noting: “This is \n",
      "French.” It is so atmospheric for him to be French, that he can devote \n",
      "himself to saying: “This is human.” This is an imperative condition for \n",
      "the creating of deep art. The whole will and mind of the creator must \n",
      "go below the surfaces of race. And this has been an almost impossible \n",
      "condition for the American Negro to achieve, forced every moment of his \n",
      "life into a specific and superficial plane of consciousness. \n",
      " \n",
      "The first negative significance of _Cane_ is that this so natural \n",
      "and restrictive state of mind is completely lacking. For Toomer, \n",
      "the Southland is not a problem to be solved; it is a field of \n",
      "loveliness to be sung: the Georgia Negro is not a downtrodden soul \n",
      "to be uplifted; he is material for gorgeous painting: the segregated \n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "self-conscious brown belt of Washington is not a topic to be discussed \n",
      "and exposed; it is a subject of beauty and of drama, worthy of creation \n",
      "in literary form. \n",
      " \n",
      "It seems to me, therefore, that this is a first book in more ways \n",
      "than one. It is a harbinger of the South’s literary maturity: of its \n",
      "emergence from the obsession put upon its minds by the unending racial \n",
      "crisis—an obsession from which writers have made their indirect escape \n",
      "through sentimentalism, exoticism, polemic, “problem” fiction, and \n",
      "moral melodrama. It marks the dawn of direct and unafraid creation. \n",
      "And, as the initial work of a man of twenty-seven, it is the harbinger \n",
      "of a literary force of whose incalculable future I believe no reader of \n",
      "this book will be in doubt. \n",
      " \n",
      "How typical is _Cane_ of the South’s still virgin soil and of its \n",
      "pressing seeds! and the book’s chaos of verse, tale, drama, its \n",
      "rhythmic rolling shift from lyrism to narrative, from mystery to \n",
      "intimate pathos! But read the book through and you will see a \n",
      "complex and significant form take substance from its chaos. Part One \n",
      "is the primitive and evanescent black world of Georgia. Part Two is \n",
      "the threshing and suffering brown world of Washington, lifted by \n",
      "opportunity and contact into the anguish of self-conscious struggle. \n",
      "Part Three is Georgia again ... the invasion into this black womb of \n",
      "the ferment seed: the neurotic, educated, spiritually stirring Negro. \n",
      "As a broad form this is superb, and the very looseness and unexpected \n",
      "waves of the book’s parts make _Cane_ still more _South_, still more of \n",
      "an æsthetic equivalent of the land. \n",
      " \n",
      "What a land it is! What an Æschylean beauty to its fateful problem! \n",
      "Those of you who love our South will find here some of your love. Those \n",
      "of you who know it not will perhaps begin to understand what a warm \n",
      "splendor is at last at dawn. \n",
      " \n",
      "    A feast of moon and men and barking hounds, \n",
      "    An orgy for some genius of the South \n",
      "    With bloodshot eyes and cane-lipped scented mouth \n",
      "    Surprised in making folk-songs.... \n",
      " \n",
      "So, in his still sometimes clumsy stride (for Toomer is finally a \n",
      "poet in prose) the author gives you an inkling of his revelation. An \n",
      "individual force, wise enough to drink humbly at this great spring of \n",
      "his land ... such is the first impression of Jean Toomer. But beyond \n",
      "this wisdom and this power (which shows itself perhaps most splendidly \n",
      "in his complete freedom from the sense of persecution), there rises \n",
      "a figure more significant: the artist, hard, self-immolating, the \n",
      "artist who is not interested in races, whose domain is Life. The book’s \n",
      "final Part is no longer “promise”; it is achievement. It is no mere \n",
      "dawn: it is a bit of the full morning. These materials ... the ancient \n",
      "black man, mute, inaccessible, and yet so mystically close to the new \n",
      "tumultuous members of his race, the simple slave Past, the shredding \n",
      "Negro Present, the iridescent passionate dream of the To-morrow ... \n",
      "are made and measured by a craftsman into an unforgettable music. The \n",
      "notes of his counterpoint are particular, the themes are of intimate \n",

      "and stoops to get in under Halsey’s arm. He is awkward and ludicrous, \n",

      "her unwitting attention. Their meeting is a swift sun-burst. Lewis \n",
      "impulsively moves towards her. His mind flashes images of her life \n",
      "in the southern town. He sees the nascent woman, her flesh already \n",
