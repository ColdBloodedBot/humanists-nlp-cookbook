    "Unfortunately, humanities data is frequently produced without computational analysis in mind. While the ultimate goal is to get to text data, there are often cases when the format of the particular object is not amenable to quick and easy analysis. PDF is one format that can be deceptive and difficult to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, it is necessary to distinguish between the image of a text and the actual textual data encoded alongside it. A PDF, as it is an image, can usually not be edited or searched. Unlike images of text, plain text can be searched, easily edited, and, important to us, easily used in NLP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, then, is to determine whether or not the text you are looking at actually has text within it. If it does, there are a variety of packages that allow us to pull out that textual data. We will look at two packages, PDFminer.six and OCRopus. Of the two, PDFminer is the easier to set up, and may well be the more user friendly for most needs including extracting textual data and converting PDFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "OCRopus may feel less user friendly to the novice coder. Ultimately, though, it is a more powerful tool that will allow you to run Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on your PDFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both packages have the ability to recognize a varitey of fonts and characters, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages in the case of PDFminer.six and, in the case of OCRopus, Latin, Greek, Urdu, Sanskirt, and Devanagri. Additionaly, OCRopus allows you to train your own language-independent data models, especially helpful should you be working with languages or scripts that are no longer commonly used.\n",
