    "If you're new to this kind of work, you might be coming to programming after having taken a course in programming, worked through a book or two on your own, or done some exercises while working through an online programming course. That's great! Odds are pretty good that you've also been making the work unnecessarily difficult for yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're programming for the first time, you were probably writing code with little help. In other words, you only found out that there was a problem with your code after you ran it and something broke. There is good reason for this workflow - it forces you to learn some basic syntax and memorize fundamental concepts before you learn to rely on other aids. But, in practice, many programmers make use of a linter, a piece of software that makes notes of style guide violations and outright errors. These powerful little tools can go a long way in helping to enforce good programming practices, and getting one set up on your system can make one a lot easier. Part of the reason I suggest using Atom is that it comes with a number of linters for a variety of languages baked in."
