But the common words that they share might give a good sense of the particulars of their own literary style, the way in which they write. Let's use this principle to compare Jacob's Room with The Voyage Out."

    "As expected, many of the same words appear in both lists. Note that Jacob's Room has a male pronoun in the top ten most common words, while The Voyage Out does not. This makes sense - Jacob's Room is at least nominally about a character named Jacob. But this character is presented in an elliptical way, primarily through the descriptions and recollections of other characters, which is to some degree reflected in the fact that 'her' just barely edges out 'his' in the text. You could use this information in conjunction with other metrics about the text to make larger arguments about the representation of character and gender. We could combine this sort of analysis with one that takes into account punctuation use to get a better sense of an author's particular style."
