    "The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is one of the longest standing and robust digital humanities projects. Thanks to the longstanding work of the TEI consortium, scholars have extensive tools at their disposal for encoding the nuances of textual data in a systematic way. Once a text has been organized and encoded, it can sometimes be difficult to tell what might come next for your encoded and shared documents. There are number of possibilities related to display and archiving, but let's take a look at the analytical affordances of such structured data."
